# Angular-5-World-7-Wonders-App
Angular 5 app was built to list all the wonders of the world by using angular-cli/bootstrap 4. 
Project skelton was created using angular cli version 1.6.5.
App fetches the data from json file and lists all wonders of the world. When you click on each wonder it would list details of the specific wonder.
In this project I had used angular services,angular components, nested components. Project also uses font awesome css.
